    "summary": "With a background in both computer science and applied cognitive psychology, I am a versatile 'Swiss army knife' researcher, equally at ease with technical and theoretical work in Human-Robot and Human-Computer Interaction. My expertise lies in Extended Reality, proxemic behaviors, and Human-Drone Interaction—the core pillars of my thesis project. A lifelong learner driven by the question 'but why?', I am passionate about tackling unresolved problems through innovative approaches—because the answers are out there, waiting to be uncovered.",
