> ðŸ“Œ **Current Status:** Looking for a Post Doctoral position in Europe, on Human-Robot Interactions, or Extended Reality. Feel free to contact me and check my <a href="https://robinbretin.github.io/cv">CV</a>!

<p>With a background in both computer science and applied cognitive psychology, I am a versatile 'Swiss army knife' researcher, equally at ease with technical and theoretical work in Human-Robot and Human-Computer Interaction. My expertise lies in Extended Reality (XR), proxemic behaviors, and Human-Drone Interactionâ€”the core pillars of my thesis project. A lifelong learner driven by the question 'but why?', I am passionate about tackling unresolved problems through innovative approachesâ€”because the answers are out there, waiting to be uncovered.</p>
<p>I've also collaborated on a variety of exciting projects, from child safety in social VR (with <a href="https://www.cristinafiani.com/">Cristina Fiani</a>) and authentication techniques for ATMs (with <a href="http://fmathis.com/">Florian Mathis</a>) to enhancing social robot interactions (with <a href="https://shaun-macdonald-hci.owlstown.net/">Shaun McDonald</a>).</p>
<p>Beyond research, my interests are all over the place, keeping me inspired and thinking. These include playing music, reading, woodcarving, programming, video games, films, sports, and learning new languages. Since the time I've written this, Iâ€™ve probably engaged in a new personal project.</p>
